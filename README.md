# Using **EXCEL** to Modify & Analyze Kickstarter Data

## Questions Answered:

### **1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?**

####    1. In the United States, even though the percentage of successful campaigns is higher in the theatre category (32%) compared to the music category (30%), the percentage of failures in theatre far outweighs that of music (40% vs. 18%), making music a safer categorical choice.
####    2. Within the music campaigns of the United States, the sub-category of rock music is by far the most successful subcategory compared to all others (49% of all successful campaigns in music), while also having a 0% failure and cancellation rate. 
####    3. Futhermore, there seems to be a higher rate of successful outcomes in the music category if the campaign launches within the month of May. 

### **2. What are some of the limitations of the dataset?**

### **3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?**
