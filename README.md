# Using _EXCEL_ to Modify & Analyze Kickstarter Data

## **_Questions Answered:_**

### **1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?**

#### In the United States, even though the percentage of successful campaigns is higher in the theatre category (32%) compared to the music category (30%), the percentage of failures in theatre far outweighs that of music (40% vs. 18%), making music a safer categorical choice.
#### Within the music campaigns of the United States, the sub-category of rock music is by far the most successful subcategory compared to all others (49% of all successful campaigns in music), while also having a 0% failure and cancellation rate. 
#### Futhermore, there seems to be a higher rate of successful outcomes in the music category if the campaign launches within the month of May. 

### **2. What are some of the limitations of the dataset?**
#### Limitations of this dataset include the lack of information on the following; information on the re-launching of any previously failed campaigns and their outcomes, information concerning the reasoning behind a campaign's cancellation, and information on what timepoints the campaigns begain gaining backers and pledges. 

### **3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?**
#### It would be interesting to create a pivot stacked bar graph depicting the campaigns' states, or outcomes, based on how much time the campaigns had before their deadlines were reached. This may possibly give a look into how long a campaign should run before increases in failures start to rise higher than successes on average.
